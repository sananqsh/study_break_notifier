# study_break_notifier
### Notify breaks times for yourself to optimize your study hours! 

This project was inspired by a studying method suggested by [Professor Marty Lodbell](https://youtu.be/IlU-zDU6aQ0?t=264).

*"Don`t study hard, study smart"* as he says. *"Things that we are enforced, we tend to do more of, things that are punished or ignored, we tend to do less of."*
 What Prof. Lodbell suggests is to take breaks to do fun stuff, for most people, each 30mins needs a 5min recharge.

This app notifies you each x-minutes to take a break, and then lets you know when the y-minute break is over. x and y are set to 25 and 5 by default, but the user is able to change these values.
